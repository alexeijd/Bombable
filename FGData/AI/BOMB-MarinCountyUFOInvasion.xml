		<description>This scenario puts three UFOs in the skies over Marin County, starting at the Marin Ranch Airport, CA35.

If you take off from runway 22 of the Marin Ranch Airport (CA35), the UFOs will be directly above you as you take off.  The three UFOs will find and attack you.

The UFOs are air-to-air targets, you can damage them with heavy guns, machine guns, or (if you can hit them!) heavy bombs.
  
When you shoot or bomb the UFOs they will catch fire, slow down, fall, and finally crash (to see the smoke and fire you must have Particles enabled in View/Rendering Options).

To damage the UFOs takes one or more direct hits from a machine gun or heavy gun, or a close strike by a heavy bomb.  The UFOs are specially battle hardened in the UFO factory on a forgotten asteroid in the Callisto system.  So they are pretty difficult to damage.

Install this scenario in the FlightGear/data/AI directory.

Any aircraft that shoots guns or drops bombs can damage the UFO.  You can choose the bombable UFO and have a UFO duel . . . 

Suggestion: Turn AI aircraft flying skill to "disabled" in the Bombable menu.  You'll never catch UFOs if they are maneuvering at 1000 MPH.  If they are flying straight, maybe . . . 

Suggestion: Turn multiplayer mode off.  Marin Ranch is close to KSFO and you'll pick up all the multiplayer action there, greatly slowing your framerate.
