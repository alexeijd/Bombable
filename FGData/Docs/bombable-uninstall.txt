HOW TO UNINSTALL BOMBABLE

As of version 4.4 and later, Bombable no longer overwrites any 
existing files or aircraft in the standard FlightGear installation. 

It adds new aircraft, AI aircraft, and scenarios but does not change any 
currently installed aircraft. It will overwrite files from any 
previous Bombable installation but will not change any other files in your
FlightGear directories.

That means it is very easy to disable or uninstall Bombable--you don't 
need to wipe & re-install your FlightGear installation.

DO YOU NEED TO UNINSTALL BOMBABLE?

You can disable the Bombable module, leaving it installed and ready to use 
when you want it, but having very little effect on your FlightGear experience. 
Start FlightGear, click the Bombable menu/Bombable Options. Uncheck "Bombable 
module enabled" and click Save.

With the Bombable module disabled, you may wish to leave it in place.  You
can re-enable it whenever you like or leave it disabled.

However, if you'd like to remove Bombable altogether, here are the instructions.

STEP BY STEP UNINSTALLATION

1. Delete file data/Nasal/bombable.nas

  This will be found in your FlightGear installation directory, subdirectories 
  data/Nasal.
  
  This is the main step you need to disable/uninstall Bombable.

  Once you have done this, the Aircraft, AI Aircraft, and scenarios that 
  Bombable installed still remain. You can remove these if you like with the 
  following three steps.

2. Remove Aircraft files  

  Bombable installs a number of aircraft in the data/Aircraft directory.
  
  All of these directories include "-Bombable" at the end of the name.  
  
  Examples:
  
     A-10-Bombable
     F6F-Hellcat-Bombable
     etc.
  
  Simple delete these directories and these aircraft will be removed 
  from your installation.

3. Remove AI Aircraft files
  
  Bombable installs a number of AI aircraft in the data/Aircraft directory.
  
  With one exception, these directories include "-Bombable" at the end of the name.  
  
  Examples:
  
     Fire-Particles
     sopwithCamel-Bombable
     SPAD-VII-Bombable
     ufo-Bombable
     etc.
  
  Simple delete these directories and these aircraft will be removed 
  from your installation.  
  
4. Remove scenarios
  
  Bombable installs a number of scenarios in the data/AI directory.
  
  All of these scenarios include "Bomb-" at the start of the filename.
  
  Examples:  
  
    BOMB-Columbia-CA-Tank-Invasion1.xml
    BOMB-Kansas-City-Bombable-Testbed.xml
    BOMB-MarinCountyB-17BombersWithZeroCover.xml
    etc.  
  
  Simple delete these files and these scenarios will be removed 
  from your installation. 

That's it!  Your Bombable installation is un-installed.
