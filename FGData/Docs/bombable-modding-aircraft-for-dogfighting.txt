MODDING AIRCRAFT AND SCENERY OBJECTS TO BECOME BOMBABLE

**Following are instructions for modding an aircraft to become 
Bombable able to use multiplayer dogfighting. This works with the 
Bombable mod for FlightGear 1.9.1 and 2.X.X. See bombable-readme.txt 
for details about getting the whole package installed and working.**

**Your best instructions for modding a FG aircraft to use with
Bombable is to look at the example aircraft (both AI aircraft and
normal aircraft) that are included in this package. The instructions
below and in the Wiki will make much more sense with these real-world,
working examples at your fingertips as you read the instructions.**

The techniques used here to make objects bombable, detect hits, 
create contrails, smoke columns, flares, drive objects along the 
ground (moving tanks/jeeps), navigate ships through the water, 
create ground-hugging aircraft, etc., create aircraft that will 
dogfight with the main aircraft, can all be added to any AI aircraft 
by including a few lines of code in their XML files.

Conceivably they could be included in any Sim aircraft as well, 
making all aircraft bombable. Scenery objects, too, could 
potentially become "bombable".

More information about Bombable is on the FlightGear wiki:

MP aircraft bombable is here:

BRIEF INSTRUCTIONS
To make an existing aircraft bombable and work with MP dogfighting requires:

 - Create an AI version of the aircraft
 
 - Include working armament in the aircraft, preferably set to report impacts 
to ai/models/model-impact (but any of the standard places to report impacts 
should work). See further details below.

 - Add lines of code to make the AI version bombable (see the AI 
aircraft in this release for examples you can copy/paste/modify). 
Here you can specify everything from how easy/hard it is to damage 
the object to how vigorously and turns and attacks the main aircraft.

 - If you want to use different liveries for different levels of damage you can 
do that. See further instructions below and the M1-Abrams and Jeep-bombable 
XML files for examples.

 - To enable multiplayer dogfighting, in the aircraft's -set.xml file, add a 
generic multiplayer communications port (string) in the <sim> section of the 
file. To avoid conflicts with other MP items we've chosen to use string[9] for 
bombable communication. The lines needed look something like this:

 <sim>
 
       .... (a whole bunch of stuff)
       
       <multiplay>
         <generic>
           <string n="9" type="string"/>
           <int n="10" alias="controls/armament/trigger" />
         </generic>
       </multiplay>    
       .... (more bunches of stuff)
       
  </sim>
  

HELPING BOMBABLE DETECT YOUR IMPACTS

The listener function to detect impacts listens on all known impact-reports 
nodes used by aircraft in the FG CVS version as of August 2009.  This means
the impacts should be detected from weapons used in these aircraft, and
most likely many others:

A-10	Arsenal VG-33	B-1B	BF109	BO105	F4U	F-16	F-117	FW190	Horten-O
Hunter	IL-2	LA-5	ME-262	ME-262 HGIII	Seahawk	Sopwith Camel	SPAD VII	
Spitfire	Submarine Scout	Vulcan 2B

Note that not all of these have actual weapons--some may have something
like a drop-tank that is ballistic and can impact other objects.

The listener function also listens to the standard impact-reports node, 
ai/models/model-impact, so any aircraft using that standard node should work 
fine.

If you are an aircraft designer and want to make sure your aircraft's 
armaments work with this system, just make sure your armament's impact
uses one of the standard impact-reports nodes used by other FG aircraft,
or preferably use the standard FG default reporting.   In a submodel XML
file the impact reports line would look like this:

   <impact-reports>ai/models/model-impact</impact-reports>
  
  
ADDING CHANGEABLE LIVERY COLORS THAT DEPEND ON DAMAGE LEVEL 

With the code above, bombable.nas will handle setting the livery colors and
automatically changing them as the object becomes damaged.  
For this to work your model must have different liveries available
and then animate the liveries so that the texture used is the one shown
in this path: /ai/model/model[X]/bombable/texture-corps-path.  The /ai/model/model[X]/ part is assumed for AI craft so you need to add <texture-prop>bombable/texture-corps-path</texture-prop> in the right place of your XML file. 

Example from Jeep.xml in the jeep-bombable directory:

<animation>
		<type>material</type>
		<object-name>jeep-body</object-name>
				<object-name>roof1</object-name>
    <object-name>roof2</object-name>
    <object-name>softroof</object-name>
		<object-name>chassis</object-name>
		<object-name>chassis.002</object-name>
		<object-name>Plane</object-name>
		<object-name>hinge</object-name>
		<object-name>screen</object-name>
		<object-name>wiper.L</object-name>
		<object-name>wiper.R</object-name>
		<object-name>seat.L</object-name>
		<object-name>seat.R</object-name>
    <texture-prop>bombable/texture-corps-path</texture-prop>
		<transparency>
			<alpha>1.0</alpha>
		</transparency>
	</animation>
  

Additionally, if you want to change your object's the livery color programmatically (for instance, if you include a menu item to select different liveries) you can use the following code to change all liveries, including damage liveries, that the object uses:

Example:
     liveries = [
         "Models/livery_nodamage.png", 
         "Models/livery_slightdamage.png", 
         "Models/livery_highdamage.png");
     ];

     bombable.set_livery (cmdarg().getPath(), liveries); 

You can include liveries for as many different levels of damage (ie, fine gradations of change from undamaged to completely damaged) as you like.  For instance:


Example:
     liveries = [
         "Models/livery_nodamage.png", 
         "Models/livery_barelydamaged.png", 
         "Models/livery_justslightlydamaged.png", 
         "Models/livery_alittlemoredamage.png", 
         "Models/livery_fairlydamaged.png",          
         "Models/livery_kindadamaged.png",
         "Models/livery_prettydamaged.png",
         "Models/livery_whoawereintroublenow.png",                   
         "Models/livery_finishedoff.png");
     ];

     bombable.set_livery (cmdarg().getPath(), liveries);
